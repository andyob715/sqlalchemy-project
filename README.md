Butler Data Bootcamp Homework Submission - SQLAlchemy

## SQLAlchemy Portion

* Completed all required submission items
* Bonus was not attempted for this portion

### SQLAlchemy Challenges

* Completion required additional tutoring sessions to to understand the connection between ORM > creating sessions > executing queries but once that was clear it was not too bad

### SQLAlchmeny Thoughts

* I'm not sure in what ways this is applicable to me in the real world yet, additional exposure required to fully grasp use
* The ability to create dataframes and run different matplotlib graphing options was very interesting and far easier than SQL

## Flask Portion

* I am not certain that all requests were satisfactorily covered in my homework submission
* SQLlite would not run for me via VSCode and I needed to download and insert the appropriate DLLs into my Anacondas VM "PythonData"

### Flask Challenges

* I was not sure exactly how to execute on the directions
* Sample file was included in Gitlab download and I couldn't tell if this was to be modified for individual purposes or if this was just a sample

### Flask Thoughts

* Despite the challenges understanding the homework, I thought this was a very interesting exercise
* I really enjoyed typing in the URL bar my Routes and see the data return as expected
